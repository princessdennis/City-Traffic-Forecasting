# City-Traffic-Forecasting
I'm using smart city data collected using IOT technologies to analyze traffic patterns and forecast future traffic volume to improve infrastructure planning.

## traffic-data
Data downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/vetrirah/ml-iot

## visualization.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook with methods of time data breakdowns, analyses, and visualizations. I built visualization pipelines that analyzed traffic patterns by weekday, month, year, and hour of the day for the 4 different traffic junctions. Pipeline leveraged ipywidget tools to provide efficient data comparisons.

## Incoming Work
Forecasting traffic in different city junctions using both deep learning and tradition time series techniques.
